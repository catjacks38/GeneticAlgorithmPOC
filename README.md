## A Simple Genetic Algorithm Implemented into C# as a Proof of Concept

This is just a proof of concept, and to help anyone trying to implement a genetic algorithm into their own program. So, I will not commit to this repo a lot.

Due to the simplicity of the genetic algorithm, you only need a basic understanding of some simple math and some knowledge of natural selection.
